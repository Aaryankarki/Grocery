    <h2>Connecting Farmers & Households Through Campa Store</h2>
    <img src="/Image/vege.png" class="blog-image" alt="image">
    <p>Mr. Jhon Charles has been involved with Campa Store since January 2021. 
        He signed up as a farmer and not only started receiving products and services including farm 
        tools, modern machinery, advisory, and training from Campa Store, but also started selling his 
        produce through the Campa Store's Webpage. Ever since he has been able to benefit greatly from the 
        platform and expresses his gratitude.</p>
        <img src="/Image/Fruits.jpeg" class="blog-image" alt="image">
    <p>Campa platform has many applications and businesses under its umbrella creating a perfect 
       ecosystem capable of disrupting the way farming and consumption is done in Nepal. Procuring 
       fresh vegetables, fruits, and produce directly from local farmers, Campa platform uses Campa FOOD
        under its ecosystem to sell and deliver the fresh produce directly to households. </p>
    <p>At Campa Store, while we aim to genuinely support all the farmers with increasing the overall output at
       their farms and also with finding higher rates for their products by avoiding middlemen, our ability
       to accommodate more farmers in our network relies on the demand being generated within Campa Store. 
       By generating more and more demand, we can help more and more farmers. So you can be a part of this change,
       this disruption that we are aiming for, by purchasing through our platform. There are other reasons why Campa Food
       is one of the best online platforms for buying fresh vegetables, fruits, bakeries, coffee, groceries, and more. First, 
       we deliver fresh fruits and vegetables at your doorstep just at the click of a few buttons. Second, we guarantee the 
       quality of the produce that we deliver. If you are not satisfied with the quality, we will replace your delivery. Third, you 
       can buy vegetables and fruits online for your households or buy bulk quantities for your businesses and the produce are 
       available in many types including organic, local, and regular market fresh categories.</p>
       <img src="/Image/Farm.png" class="blog-image" alt="image">
    <p>If you are a conscious consumer and feel good about our initiative, we are super delighted and want you to know that
       we are not only thinking about farmers, we are also thinking about consumers like yourself. We want to establish a 
       transparent and reliable supply chain that can bring local and organic vegetables, fruits, and more to your doorstep
       at an affordable price. The problems with consuming foods grown with a lot of pesticides and chemical inputs are being 
       more and more evident with facts like rapid increase in diseases including cancer, endocrine problems, and more. </p>
